  Say you're building an app that needs to send emails. We all agree that we should never block the controller, so async delivery is the way to go. To achieve this, we'll move our email sending code outside the original request/response cycle with the help of an asynchronous processing library that can handle jobs in the background.
  How can we be confident that our code behaves as expected upon making this change? In this blog post, we'll look at a way to test it. And we'll use MiniTest (since it ships with Rails) but the concepts presented here can be easily translated to RSpec.
